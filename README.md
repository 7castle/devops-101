# DevOps 101

##Introduction

### What is DevOps?
DevOps is about collaboration and integeration between developers and operations. We do DevOps so that we can have faster and more reliable development and deployment cycles.

### What's it to me?
As a graduate developer, DevOps will mostly be a foreign concept to you. Going into your first few projects, you may feel that you don't need to understand the DevOps side of the project. Perhaps you will find it daunting, or perhaps you will think that DevOps should be left to the "DevOpsy people" on the team. 

Whilst a lot of projects will have people dedicated to some sort of DevOps role, DevOps *should* be the responsibility of the entire team. As such, it is the responsibility of those "DevOpsy people" to share the DevOps knowledge amongst the team, and it is the responsibility of the entire team to be open to acquiring such knowledge.

The most valuable team members are those who can swing from tweaking the source code to tweaking configuration scripts at a moment's notice. Be that team member.
